Can't code? Can't hack? Can't do anything cool on the command line?
This game will give you an excuse to spend some time in the terminal nevertheless.

Be a cool kid, be in the terminal. Play nudoku!

As a bonus you will even learn the basic **vi** movement commands.

### Installation

If you run openSUSE just copy the following into your terminal (yes! the terminal, whoohoo.):

`zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games/openSUSE_13.2/ games`

`zypper in nudoku`

If you don't, well, go read the [readme](https://github.com/jubalh/nudoku/blob/master/README.md).
